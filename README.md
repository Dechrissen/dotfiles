# dotfiles

This is a collection of the various dotfiles and configs I use on Arch-based systems.

## scripts

The `scripts` directory contains shell scripts that you can adapt and use on your own system if you wish to use my dotfiles.

`pull-local-changes.sh` - Pulls local changes to dotfiles on your system into this dotfiles repo (if cloned to your machine).
